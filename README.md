# DevPortfolio Template

A modern, minimalist portfolio template built with Astro and Tailwind CSS. Perfect for developers looking to showcase their skills, experience, and projects in a clean, professional way.

This was completely rebuilt from the ground up from V1. This template was built to be entirely ready to go with a quick config edit (see below) but also provides the ability to easily extend in whatever way you want.

This template also comes with `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursor/rules` files for easy integration with your existing AI workflows.

## Updating the Template

### Configuration

The template is designed to be easily customizable through the `src/config.ts` file. This single file controls:

- **Personal Information**: Name, title, description
- **Accent Color**: Primary color theme (changing this will change the accent color site wide)
- **Social Links**: Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub (all optional)
- **About Section**: Personal bio/description
- **Skills**: List of technical skills
- **Projects**: Project showcase with descriptions and links
- **Experience**: Work history with bullet points
- **Education**: Educational background and achievements

If skills, projects, experience, or education are removed from the config, those sections will be hidden entirely.

### Example structures

Here's what the config data structure looks like for each section:

#### Basic Information
```typescript

aboutMe: "As a 4th year Computer Engineering student at Marinduque State University, I have developed a strong curiosity for how technology can be applied to improve everyday life. My academic journey has given me opportunities to explore both hardware and software, allowing me to work on projects that involve automation, embedded systems, and applied research. I enjoy turning ideas into working solutions and learning new methods to improve them.
What motivates me most is the challenge of problem-solving. Whether through designing circuits, writing code, or testing systems, I approach tasks with persistence and creativity. I also value collaboration, as working with others helps me gain new perspectives and produce better results. Beyond academics, I continue to explore technology through self-study and side projects, building a mindset that is adaptable and forward-looking."
